Tauburn's color scheme is mainly red, white and gold but with blue for the orb in Tauburn's chest from which Takuto pilots his respective Cybody . Tauburn also has a set of Piles on it's lower back which could possibly resemble the loose tail of a jacket. In episode 16, Tauburn's appearance undergoes some minor changes; the orb in the middle takes a red colour, the spherical Cybody joints became white, the solid red colour on Tauburn's chest becomes white with red stripes, the masquerade mask gains a long spike under each eye, the hat becomes a bit wider, the shoulder armor gains a more V-like shape, Tauburn's shoes also have spikes and the two outer Piles are elongated.","name":"タウバーン","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"Tauburn"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"Taubarn"},{"v":"タウバーン・オーディナリー"}]},{"key":"引用来源","value":"http://stardriver.wikia.com/wiki/Tauburn"}],"stat":{"comments":4,"collects":22},"id":13110,"locked":false,"type":2,"nsfw":false}
