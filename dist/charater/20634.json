She wields twin shotgun gauntlets called Ember Celica. Her Semblance works on a \"recoil-based system\": whenever Yang takes a hit, her strength, toughness and striking power rise in proportion to her injuries. Her glowing hair and eye color change are caused by excess energy from the buildup, which also results in Yang often acting very \"hotheaded\" in battle.\r\n\r\nYang is the \"big sister\" of the group, caring deeply for her teammates. She is also very optimistic, never giving up in battle and hard times. Yang has revealed that her birth mother left her family shortly after she was born and hasn't been seen since, which acts as a driving force for her character. She has been determined to find Raven ever since she realized that Summer Rose, Ruby's mother who also helped raise Yang, wasn't her own biological mother. Yang wanted to become a Huntress because of the adventure, she calls herself a thrill-seeker in search of a life where she doesn't know what lies ahead of her.\r\n\r\nNear the end of Volume 3, during the Battle of Beacon, Yang's right arm is severed by White Fang member Adam Taurus, following a desperate attempt to help a wounded Blake. In the aftermath of the fall of Beacon, she is bedridden in her home on the island of Patch, where she has become bitter and depressed. After the time-skip between Volume 3 and 4, Yang is still on Patch, trying to get used to life with one arm. She shows signs of PTSD after the events of Volume 3, having visions and nightmares of Adam cutting her arm. She is also shown to be hesitant to use a bionic arm sent to her by General Ironwood. After an encouraging talk with her father Taiyang, Prof. Port, and Dr. Oobleck, in which Yang admits to being scared of moving on, she puts the arm on and resumes training with her father. While sparring, Yang learns to fight without relying on her Semblance as much as she did before, and learns more about her mother from Taiyang. In the volume finale, she arrives at Anima and heads for Mistral to find Ruby.\r\n\r\nYang is an allusion to Goldilocks; her name in Chinese is 陽小龍 and translates to \"sun little dragon\". Prior to the series, one of Oum's Tweets had a photograph of his computer monitor that reveals a file named \"Taiyang Xiao Long\", later revealed to be the name of Yang's father.","name":"Yang Xiao Long","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"阳小龙"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ヤン・シャオロン"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"},{"key":"武器","value":"Ember Celica（灰烬天堂）"}],"stat":{"comments":20,"collects":89},"id":20634,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false}
