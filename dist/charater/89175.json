She herself is poor and is all time taking on a new job, because she gets fired for having to leave and fight monsters all the time. She transforms into the white bunny Valerian by using the \"bracelet of the flower\" which is attached to her left arm. She is the blond character, and is the leader of the team. She tries to get the monsters to talk instead of fight, but then she ends up attacking first anyway. Powdered Valerian root is often used as a mellowing sleep aid.","name":"カノコ","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"罗马字","v":"Poppu"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"}],"stat":{"comments":0,"collects":0},"id":89175,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false}
