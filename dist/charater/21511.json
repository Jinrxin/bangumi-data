Born in the city of Wind Path and abandoned by his mother as a child, Roman became a pickpocket from Mistral in his younger days. After he was caught by members of Spider and was taken under the wing of Lil' Miss Malachite, he became her second-in-command until he started becoming more ambitious than her and defected from the gang to become independent while eventually meeting Neopolitan in the process.\r\n\r\nLater becoming a wanted criminal in Vale, he made a very small cameo in the \"Yellow\" Trailer before being properly introduced in \"Ruby Rose\". There, he orchestrated the robbery of Dust supplies from the store From Dust Till Dawn, but was ultimately foiled by Ruby Rose and briefly imprisoned by Atlas forces after a Vale Grimm invasion.\r\n\r\nHis weapon of choice was his cane, known as Melodic Cudgel. He served as the main antagonist of Volume 1 and the secondary antagonist of Volumes 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nIn \"Heroes and Monsters\", he was swallowed by a Griffon after fighting Ruby atop a hijacked Atlesian Airship.\r\n\r\nHe features as a main character in the novel, RWBY: Roman Holiday.","name":"Roman Torchwick","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ローマン・トーチウィック"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"男"},{"key":"引用来源","value":"rwby wiki"}],"stat":{"comments":4,"collects":6},"id":21511,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false}
