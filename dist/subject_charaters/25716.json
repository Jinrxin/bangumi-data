As a young, charismatic leader forged in battle and the heritage of war, he began to believe in a grand purpose for his race—it is the Transformers' glorious destiny to rule an empire which will span the universe. The opposite of his mortal enemy Optimus Prime, he feels great contempt for other Transformers who, he feels, betray their proud heritage by demanding peace and cooperation with weaker life forms. It is the destiny of the Decepticons to bring order to the universe through conquest, though in the millions of years since coining this purpose it remains to be seen how much of his mission statement is altruistic... and how much of it is mere words built to fuel warriors to further his desire for personal power.\r\n\r\nMegatron will attempt almost anything to achieve his goals, but his schemes are rarely in any way subtle. This is perhaps due to his arrogance, but his pride is not so strong as to dissuade him from abandoning a battle he is losing. He often shows dramatic examples of cowardice, concealed in rage. Although he isn't as physically strong as Optimus, his ability to analyze any situation and utilize it as a weapon makes the Decepticons deadly, so they can find energy sources almost immediately. Some would question his sanity, though these few are mostly now dead by his hands... or his fusion cannon, depending on his mood. Sometimes he uses his energon mace to strike them down. It does not matter how they die. Death by the hands of Megatron is an honor.\r\n\r\nMegatron is often reborn as Galvatron.","name":"Megatron","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"威震天"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"买个床"},{"k":"第二中文名","v":"麦加登"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"男"}],"stat":{"comments":0,"collects":8},"id":70775,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"female","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/9f/b1/109971_crt_4vVL4.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/9f/b1/109971_crt_4vVL4.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/9f/b1/109971_crt_4vVL4.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/9f/b1/109971_crt_4vVL4.jpg"},"summary":"Primarily used for recon and surveillance due to her aerial alternate mode, Airazor (sometimes formerly Wing Saber) is a great asset to the Maximal cause.","name":"Airazor","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"},{"key":"引用来源","value":"https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Airazor_(BW)"}],"stat":{"comments":0,"collects":1},"id":109971,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"male","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/6b/94/159027_crt_BJz5M.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/6b/94/159027_crt_BJz5M.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/6b/94/159027_crt_BJz5M.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/6b/94/159027_crt_BJz5M.jpg"},"summary":"Dinobot is a Predacon ruled by his sense of honor.

Selfless and endlessly courageous, he is the complete opposite of his mortal enemy Megatron. Originally a mere civilian known as Orion Pax or Optronix, he was chosen by the Matrix of Leadership to command, the first in a number of heavy burdens he has been forced to bear. Another is his bringing of the Transformers' conflict to Earth. Every casualty, human or Cybertronian weighs heavily on his spark. He does not show this side to his soldiers and never succumbs to despair. The Autobots need a decisive, charismatic leader and that is what he gives them. It was that leadership which turned the tide of the Great War.\r\n\r\nOn the battlefield, there are few who rival Optimus Prime's prowess. He is easily the strongest of any Autobot his size, and his ion blaster and energon-axe are deadly weapons. He would sacrifice his life to protect his fellow Autobots or those under their care and does so on a regular basis. His compassion for other sentient beings is his only real weakness, and one the Decepticons have taken advantage of time and again... though it's also the source of his strength!","name":"Optimus Prime","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"擎天柱"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"柯柏文"},{"k":"第二中文名","v":"柯博文"},{"k":"日文名","v":"コンボイ"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"男"}],"stat":{"comments":1,"collects":15},"id":70772,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false}]}
