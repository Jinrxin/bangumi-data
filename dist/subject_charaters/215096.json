the fourth member of Team RWBY, is a yellow-haired girl and, at 17 years of age, Ruby's older half-sister. She wields twin shotgun gauntlets called Ember Celica. Her Semblance works on a \"recoil-based system\": whenever Yang takes a hit, her strength, toughness and striking power rise in proportion to her injuries. Her glowing hair and eye color change are caused by excess energy from the buildup, which also results in Yang often acting very \"hotheaded\" in battle.\r\n\r\nYang is the \"big sister\" of the group, caring deeply for her teammates. She is also very optimistic, never giving up in battle and hard times. Yang has revealed that her birth mother left her family shortly after she was born and hasn't been seen since, which acts as a driving force for her character. She has been determined to find Raven ever since she realized that Summer Rose, Ruby's mother who also helped raise Yang, wasn't her own biological mother. Yang wanted to become a Huntress because of the adventure, she calls herself a thrill-seeker in search of a life where she doesn't know what lies ahead of her.\r\n\r\nNear the end of Volume 3, during the Battle of Beacon, Yang's right arm is severed by White Fang member Adam Taurus, following a desperate attempt to help a wounded Blake. In the aftermath of the fall of Beacon, she is bedridden in her home on the island of Patch, where she has become bitter and depressed. After the time-skip between Volume 3 and 4, Yang is still on Patch, trying to get used to life with one arm. She shows signs of PTSD after the events of Volume 3, having visions and nightmares of Adam cutting her arm. She is also shown to be hesitant to use a bionic arm sent to her by General Ironwood. After an encouraging talk with her father Taiyang, Prof. Port, and Dr. Oobleck, in which Yang admits to being scared of moving on, she puts the arm on and resumes training with her father. While sparring, Yang learns to fight without relying on her Semblance as much as she did before, and learns more about her mother from Taiyang. In the volume finale, she arrives at Anima and heads for Mistral to find Ruby.\r\n\r\nYang is an allusion to Goldilocks; her name in Chinese is 陽小龍 and translates to \"sun little dragon\". Prior to the series, one of Oum's Tweets had a photograph of his computer monitor that reveals a file named \"Taiyang Xiao Long\", later revealed to be the name of Yang's father.","name":"Yang Xiao Long","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"阳小龙"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ヤン・シャオロン"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"},{"key":"武器","value":"Ember Celica（灰烬天堂）"}],"stat":{"comments":20,"collects":92},"id":20634,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"female","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/7b/97/29607_crt_0Mzpb.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/7b/97/29607_crt_0Mzpb.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/7b/97/29607_crt_0Mzpb.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/7b/97/29607_crt_0Mzpb.jpg"},"summary":"","name":"Cinder Fall","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"シンダー・フォール"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"}],"stat":{"comments":8,"collects":11},"id":29607,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"female","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/58/78/21508_crt_OpN0L.jpg?r=1517669074","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/58/78/21508_crt_OpN0L.jpg?r=1517669074","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/58/78/21508_crt_OpN0L.jpg?r=1517669074","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/58/78/21508_crt_OpN0L.jpg?r=1517669074"},"summary":"角色原型是索爾，外像力是吸收電力，能藉由吸收電能強化力量。活潑好動，和Ren是青梅竹馬，兩人都是孤兒。名字在日文中意思是「無家」，姓氏源自為北歐神話中的女武神。\r\n    武器為「神威戰錘（Magnhild）」，是一把能夠轉換成長柄戰鎚的滾筒連發榴彈砲，在第四季中還新增了可以用外像力充電使出蓄力攻擊的機能。","name":"Nora Valkyrie","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"诺拉·瓦尔基里"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ノーラ・ヴァルキリー"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"}],"stat":{"comments":9,"collects":30},"id":21508,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"female","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/54/2a/21500_crt_7r7Lx.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/54/2a/21500_crt_7r7Lx.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/54/2a/21500_crt_7r7Lx.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/54/2a/21500_crt_7r7Lx.jpg"},"summary":"CFVY (Coffee) 队成员，萌萌的兔耳，喜欢照相。","name":"Velvet Scarlatina","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ヴェルヴェット・スカーラティー"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"}],"stat":{"comments":7,"collects":12},"id":21500,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"female","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/22/98/21990_crt_KMCmK.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/22/98/21990_crt_KMCmK.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/22/98/21990_crt_KMCmK.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/22/98/21990_crt_KMCmK.jpg"},"summary":"Penny is a character in RWBY who was introduced in the episode The Stray, when she was found lying on the ground after Weiss crashed into her, chasing after Sun Wukon.","name":"Penny Polendina","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ペニー・ポレンディーナ"},{"k":"昵称","v":"Penny"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"},{"key":"引用来源","value":"http://rwby.wikia.com/wiki/Penny"}],"stat":{"comments":11,"collects":18},"id":21990,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"male","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/aa/2a/21088_crt_mIu6g.jpg?r=1655743892","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/aa/2a/21088_crt_mIu6g.jpg?r=1655743892","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/aa/2a/21088_crt_mIu6g.jpg?r=1655743892","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/aa/2a/21088_crt_mIu6g.jpg?r=1655743892"},"summary":"中國風的黑髮少年，武器（兩把附有刀刃的綠色衝鋒槍）令人下意識的想起螳螂。\r\n兩手袖口似乎具備四次元收納功能，將兩把刃槍收納在袖口內。\r\n跟Nora是青梅竹馬。\r\n\r\nVoice Actor：\r\nMonty Oum (Volumes 1～2) \r\nNeath Oum (Volume 3～现在) \r\n斉藤壮馬 (日语版)","name":"Lie Ren","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"烈莲"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ライ・レン"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"男"},{"key":"引用来源","value":"wiki.komica.org／rwby.wikia.com"},{"key":"武器","value":"StormFlower"}],"stat":{"comments":15,"collects":25},"id":21088,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"male","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/57/d5/21510_crt_ZdvAd.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/57/d5/21510_crt_ZdvAd.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/57/d5/21510_crt_ZdvAd.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/57/d5/21510_crt_ZdvAd.jpg"},"summary":"The leader of Team JNPR.\r\nDespite coming from a long line of Huntsmen, he lacks combat skills.

Born in the city of Wind Path and abandoned by his mother as a child, Roman became a pickpocket from Mistral in his younger days. After he was caught by members of Spider and was taken under the wing of Lil' Miss Malachite, he became her second-in-command until he started becoming more ambitious than her and defected from the gang to become independent while eventually meeting Neopolitan in the process.\r\n\r\nLater becoming a wanted criminal in Vale, he made a very small cameo in the \"Yellow\" Trailer before being properly introduced in \"Ruby Rose\". There, he orchestrated the robbery of Dust supplies from the store From Dust Till Dawn, but was ultimately foiled by Ruby Rose and briefly imprisoned by Atlas forces after a Vale Grimm invasion.\r\n\r\nHis weapon of choice was his cane, known as Melodic Cudgel. He served as the main antagonist of Volume 1 and the secondary antagonist of Volumes 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nIn \"Heroes and Monsters\", he was swallowed by a Griffon after fighting Ruby atop a hijacked Atlesian Airship.\r\n\r\nHe features as a main character in the novel, RWBY: Roman Holiday.","name":"Roman Torchwick","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ローマン・トーチウィック"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"男"},{"key":"引用来源","value":"rwby wiki"}],"stat":{"comments":4,"collects":6},"id":21511,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"female","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/fa/89/20632_crt_2gRO0.jpg?r=1516523372","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/fa/89/20632_crt_2gRO0.jpg?r=1516523372","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/fa/89/20632_crt_2gRO0.jpg?r=1516523372","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/fa/89/20632_crt_2gRO0.jpg?r=1516523372"},"summary":"角色原型是白雪公主，名字取自「白雪」的德語。代表色是白色。慣用手是左手(平時戰鬥時或寫字時都是使用左手)\r\n    故事開始時是「雪倪尘晶公司」的未來繼承人。有一名姊姊Winter和一名弟弟Whitley。初登場時雖然十分認真但卻相當任性且自我，第一季時更對自己沒有成為隊長一事而對Peter Port教授大吐苦水，但在其開導下開始學習如何成為一名最好的隊員，並逐漸融入團隊中。第三季Beacon學院被摧毀時被其父親帶回Atlas，第四季時在慈善晚會上因賓客對Beacon的詆毀而與之發生爭執，一怒之下失控召喚出一頭山豬型召喚物，所幸被與會的James Ironwood將軍擋下，其後被父親剝奪繼承權並限制自由，最終在管家Klein幫助下逃家成功，前往Mistral，欲與姊姊Winter會合。第五季時因為搭乘的運輸機被女王索矛蜂襲擊而墜毀，並被Raven俘虜，並從其手下Vernal口中得知Winter被召回Atlas，之後和前來找Raven的Yang重逢，並經由Raven的能力而得以和抵達Mistral的Ruby會合。\r\n    外像力為「雕紋」；是目前已知少數可以遺傳的外像力，能施展各種法陣進行攻防，目前總共出現過吸力（黑）、斥力（白）及時間加速三種。\r\n    據其姐姐Winter所述，「雕紋」最終能召喚出類似守護者的存在（被召喚出來的會是自己過去生命中面對的強敵），其型態不一，Winter能召喚各種Grimm，而Weiss於第三季第11集時召喚出一支持有大劍的手臂，擋下了機甲對Velvet的攻擊，並將機甲一刀兩斷。第四季第九集，終於成功召喚出手持大劍的巨大騎士（該騎士為預告片中和Weiss戰鬥的對象）。\r\n    武器為「柳葉白菀（Myrtenaster）」，一把銀白色的護手細劍，護手部位裝有儲藏塵晶的中折式左輪結構，能夠根據不同用途切換使用。","name":"Weiss Schnee","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"怀丝·雪倪"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ワイス・シュニー"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"},{"key":"武器","value":"柳叶白菀 (Myrtenaster)"}],"stat":{"comments":30,"collects":132},"id":20632,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":null,"birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/58/79/29606_crt_t266P.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/58/79/29606_crt_t266P.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/58/79/29606_crt_t266P.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/58/79/29606_crt_t266P.jpg"},"summary":"RWBY中的人物，反派Roman Torchwick的助手，用伞作武器，似乎有虹膜异色症","name":"Neo Politan","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ニオ・ポリタン"},{"k":"纯假名","v":"ネオ・ポリタン"}]}],"stat":{"comments":13,"collects":25},"id":29606,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":null,"birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/23/b6/29610_crt_9NBt6.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/23/b6/29610_crt_9NBt6.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/23/b6/29610_crt_9NBt6.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/23/b6/29610_crt_9NBt6.jpg"},"summary":"","name":"Mercury Black","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"マーキュリー・ブラック"}]}],"stat":{"comments":0,"collects":1},"id":29610,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"female","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/c8/29/21509_crt_e1XzG.jpg?r=1655742439","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/200/pic/crt/l/c8/29/21509_crt_e1XzG.jpg?r=1655742439","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/c8/29/21509_crt_e1XzG.jpg?r=1655742439","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/c8/29/21509_crt_e1XzG.jpg?r=1655742439"},"summary":"A very talented fighter who graduated at the top of her class in primary combat school.

She wields Crescent Rose, a scythe that can transform into a high caliber sniper rifle. Her Semblance is called \"Speed\", enabling her to run faster than the human eye can catch, and change directions in mid-air.\r\n\r\nAs her mother Summer Rose died when she was very young, Ruby is raised on the island of Patch by her father Taiyang and older half-sister Yang Xiao Long. Her uncle Qrow Branwen teaches her how to wield a scythe and fight properly, with Ruby stating that she was \"complete garbage\" before he took her in as his pupil. At the start of the series, when she fights off a group of robbers at a Dust shop, she impresses Professor Ozpin, the headmaster of Beacon Academy, and is allowed to transfer from Signal Academy to Beacon two years early, entering in the same class as Yang, with the goal of becoming a Huntress. Inspired by the heroic fairy tales Yang read to her as a child, Ruby strives to become a Huntress to protect the world from evil. Although she is socially awkward at first, obsessed with weapons and dependent on her sister, she becomes friends with her classmates, and exhibits skills and qualities that eventually place her as the leader of Team RWBY.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fall of Beacon, Ruby learns from her uncle that she and her mother come from a line of powerful silver-eyed warriors who have been feared by Grimm since ancient times. A few months later, Ruby travels with the remaining members of Team JNPR to Haven Academy in Mistral in order to find leads on their enemies. Together, they informally call themselves Team RNJR (pronounced \"ranger\"). During their travels, Ruby is targeted by Tyrian, but she evades capture with help from her uncle.\r\n\r\nRuby alludes to the fairy tale character Little Red Riding Hood.","name":"Ruby Rose","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"露比·萝丝"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"第二中文名","v":"小红帽"},{"k":"日文名","v":"ルビー・ローズ"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"},{"key":"引用来源","value":"度娘"},{"key":"武器","value":"Crescent Rose（新月玫瑰）"}],"stat":{"comments":26,"collects":180},"id":20631,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false}]}
