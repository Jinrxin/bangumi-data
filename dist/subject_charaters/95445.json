Torchwick was a character in RWBY.

There, he orchestrated the robbery of Dust supplies from the store From Dust Till Dawn, but was ultimately foiled by Ruby Rose and briefly imprisoned by Atlas forces after a Vale Grimm invasion.\r\n\r\nHis weapon of choice was his cane, known as Melodic Cudgel. He served as the main antagonist of Volume 1 and the secondary antagonist of Volumes 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nIn \"Heroes and Monsters\", he was swallowed by a Griffon after fighting Ruby atop a hijacked Atlesian Airship.\r\n\r\nHe features as a main character in the novel, RWBY: Roman Holiday.","name":"Roman Torchwick","infobox":[{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ローマン・トーチウィック"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"男"},{"key":"引用来源","value":"rwby wiki"}],"stat":{"comments":4,"collects":6},"id":21511,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"male","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/57/d5/21510_crt_ZdvAd.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/57/d5/21510_crt_ZdvAd.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/57/d5/21510_crt_ZdvAd.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/57/d5/21510_crt_ZdvAd.jpg"},"summary":"The leader of Team JNPR.\r\nDespite coming from a long line of Huntsmen, he lacks combat skills.

She wields twin shotgun gauntlets called Ember Celica. Her Semblance works on a \"recoil-based system\": whenever Yang takes a hit, her strength, toughness and striking power rise in proportion to her injuries. Her glowing hair and eye color change are caused by excess energy from the buildup, which also results in Yang often acting very \"hotheaded\" in battle.\r\n\r\nYang is the \"big sister\" of the group, caring deeply for her teammates. She is also very optimistic, never giving up in battle and hard times. Yang has revealed that her birth mother left her family shortly after she was born and hasn't been seen since, which acts as a driving force for her character. She has been determined to find Raven ever since she realized that Summer Rose, Ruby's mother who also helped raise Yang, wasn't her own biological mother. Yang wanted to become a Huntress because of the adventure, she calls herself a thrill-seeker in search of a life where she doesn't know what lies ahead of her.\r\n\r\nNear the end of Volume 3, during the Battle of Beacon, Yang's right arm is severed by White Fang member Adam Taurus, following a desperate attempt to help a wounded Blake. In the aftermath of the fall of Beacon, she is bedridden in her home on the island of Patch, where she has become bitter and depressed. After the time-skip between Volume 3 and 4, Yang is still on Patch, trying to get used to life with one arm. She shows signs of PTSD after the events of Volume 3, having visions and nightmares of Adam cutting her arm. She is also shown to be hesitant to use a bionic arm sent to her by General Ironwood. After an encouraging talk with her father Taiyang, Prof. Port, and Dr. Oobleck, in which Yang admits to being scared of moving on, she puts the arm on and resumes training with her father. While sparring, Yang learns to fight without relying on her Semblance as much as she did before, and learns more about her mother from Taiyang. In the volume finale, she arrives at Anima and heads for Mistral to find Ruby.\r\n\r\nYang is an allusion to Goldilocks; her name in Chinese is 陽小龍 and translates to \"sun little dragon\". Prior to the series, one of Oum's Tweets had a photograph of his computer monitor that reveals a file named \"Taiyang Xiao Long\", later revealed to be the name of Yang's father.","name":"Yang Xiao Long","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"阳小龙"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"日文名","v":"ヤン・シャオロン"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"},{"key":"武器","value":"Ember Celica（灰烬天堂）"}],"stat":{"comments":20,"collects":96},"id":20634,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"male","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/f9/00/27784_crt_kmZi6.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f9/00/27784_crt_kmZi6.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/f9/00/27784_crt_kmZi6.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/f9/00/27784_crt_kmZi6.jpg"},"summary":"Sun Wukong is a student from the Kingdom of Vacuo, who later moved to Mistral and attended Haven Academy before transferring to Shade.

She wields Crescent Rose, a scythe that can transform into a high caliber sniper rifle. Her Semblance is called \"Speed\", enabling her to run faster than the human eye can catch, and change directions in mid-air.\r\n\r\nAs her mother Summer Rose died when she was very young, Ruby is raised on the island of Patch by her father Taiyang and older half-sister Yang Xiao Long. Her uncle Qrow Branwen teaches her how to wield a scythe and fight properly, with Ruby stating that she was \"complete garbage\" before he took her in as his pupil. At the start of the series, when she fights off a group of robbers at a Dust shop, she impresses Professor Ozpin, the headmaster of Beacon Academy, and is allowed to transfer from Signal Academy to Beacon two years early, entering in the same class as Yang, with the goal of becoming a Huntress. Inspired by the heroic fairy tales Yang read to her as a child, Ruby strives to become a Huntress to protect the world from evil. Although she is socially awkward at first, obsessed with weapons and dependent on her sister, she becomes friends with her classmates, and exhibits skills and qualities that eventually place her as the leader of Team RWBY.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fall of Beacon, Ruby learns from her uncle that she and her mother come from a line of powerful silver-eyed warriors who have been feared by Grimm since ancient times. A few months later, Ruby travels with the remaining members of Team JNPR to Haven Academy in Mistral in order to find leads on their enemies. Together, they informally call themselves Team RNJR (pronounced \"ranger\"). During their travels, Ruby is targeted by Tyrian, but she evades capture with help from her uncle.\r\n\r\nRuby alludes to the fairy tale character Little Red Riding Hood.","name":"Ruby Rose","infobox":[{"key":"简体中文名","value":"露比·萝丝"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"k":"第二中文名","v":"小红帽"},{"k":"日文名","v":"ルビー・ローズ"}]},{"key":"性别","value":"女"},{"key":"引用来源","value":"度娘"},{"key":"武器","value":"Crescent Rose（新月玫瑰）"}],"stat":{"comments":26,"collects":183},"id":20631,"locked":false,"type":1,"nsfw":false},{"birth_mon":null,"gender":"female","birth_day":null,"birth_year":null,"blood_type":null,"images":{"small":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/100/pic/crt/l/f2/91/21506_crt_97wQ9.jpg","grid":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f2/91/21506_crt_97wQ9.jpg","large":"https://lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/l/f2/91/21506_crt_97wQ9.jpg","medium":"https://lain.bgm.tv/r/400/pic/crt/l/f2/91/21506_crt_97wQ9.jpg"},"summary":"Glynda Goodwitch is a staff member and current Headmistress at Beacon Academy.\r\nShe was introduced in \"Ruby Rose\", in which she saved Ruby Rose from an attack by Cinder Fall.
