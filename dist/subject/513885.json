It confirms the casting of Liev Schreiber as the voice of Sam Fisher, Clancy’s iconic stealth specialist. The clip was released today during Netflix’s Geeked Week event in Atlanta. You can watch it above.\r\n\r\nSplinter Cell follows Fisher, a black ops agent working for a U.S. government division called the Fourth Echelon.\r\n\r\nIn the first look at the upcoming series, a pair of goggles sinks in water and flowers are placed on the coffin of a man named Douglas Shetland. The words “Beloved Father” are inscribed on the wooden casket, and Fisher narrates, “Once you get used to the shadows, you see bad people for who they really are. And they’ll never see you coming for them.” ","name":"Splinter Cell: Deathwatch","name_cn":"细胞分裂：死亡守望","tags":[{"name":"2025","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2025年10月","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"WEB","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"动画电影","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美国动画","count":1,"total_cont":0}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"细胞分裂：死亡守望"},{"key":"话数","value":"*"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2025年10月14日"},{"key":"放送星期","value":"星期二"},{"key":"在线播放平台","value":"Netflix"},{"key":"导演","value":"Guillaume Dousse、Félicien Colmet-Daage"},{"key":"系列构成","value":"Derek Kolstad"},{"key":"执行制片人","value":"Derek Kolstad、Hélène Juguet、Hugo Revon、Gérard Guillemot"},{"key":"动画制作","value":"Sun Creature Studios、Fost"}],"rating":{"rank":0,"total":0,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0},"score":0},"total_episodes":0,"collection":{"on_hold":1,"dropped":2,"wish":13,"collect":0,"doing":3},"id":513885,"eps":0,"meta_tags":["WEB"],"volumes":0,"series":false,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}}
